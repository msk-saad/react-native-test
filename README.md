### This is react-native-test application (My first react-native application that I have ever run).

### So, the purpose of comitting this app to GitHub is to make a note of how to run the react-native iOS app on iOS device without using macOS.

- Download the Expo GO app on iOS device.
- create the react-native project using expo
  ```npx create-expo-app@latest```
- after creating the app, start the development server. To start the development server:
  ```npx expo start```
- Once the app starts to run, and QR code will displayed in the terminal.
- Open the camera app on iOS device and scan the QR code, then open it in the *Expo GO* app.
